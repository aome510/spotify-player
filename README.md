## Introduction

- `spotify-player` is a custom Spotify player that I built and tweaked based on my personal preferences. It is fast, easy to use, and [configurable](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/doc/config.md).
- `spotify-player` is designed to be a player, not a fully-fledged Spotify clone, so it does not aim to support all possible Spotify features. Its main goal is to provide a quick and intuitive way to modify the current playback by either using player commands or navigating between different contexts.
- `spotify-player`, similar to other TUI applications, is keyboard driven. User will use a set of [predefined commands with shortcuts](#commands) to interact with the player.
- `spotify-player` has a simple UI with three main components:
  - a playback window displaying the current playback
  - a context window displaying a context (playlist, album, artist)
  - popup windows for using some commands (switch theme, browser playlists, etc) or displaying additional information
- `spotify-player` is built on top of [tui](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs), [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify), and [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) libraries. It's inspired by [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) and [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot).

## Installation

## Mouse support

Currently, the only use case of mouse is to seek to a position of the current playback by left-clicking to such position in the playback's progress bar.

## Configurations

By default, `spotify-player` will look into `$HOME/.config/spotify-player` for application's configuration files. This can be changed by either specifying `-c <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--config-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.

Please refer to [the configuration documentation](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player/blob/master/doc/config.md) for more details on the configuration options.
