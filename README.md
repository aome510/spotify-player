-it aome510/spotify_player:latest
```

## Features

### Spotify Connect

To enable a full [Spotify connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) support, user will need to register a Spotify application and specify the application's `client_id` in the general configuration file as described in the [configuration documentation](docs/config.md#general).

More details about registering a Spotify application can be found in the [official Spotify documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/).

When `spotify_player` runs with your own `client_id`, press **D** (default shortcut for `SwitchDevice` command) to get the list of available devices, then press **enter** (default shortcut for `ChooseSelected` command) to connect to the selected device.

An example of using Spotify connect to interact with the Spotify's official application:

![Spotify Connect Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/140323795-8a7ed2bb-7bda-4db2-9672-6036eac6e771.gif)

### Streaming

`spotify_player` supports streaming, which needs to be built/installed with `streaming` feature (**enabled** by default) **and** with an audio backend (`rodio-backend` by default). The streaming feature allows to `spotify_player` to play music directly from terminal.

The application uses [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) library to create an integrated Spotify client while running. The integrated client will register a Spotify speaker device under the `spotify-player` name, which is accessible on the [Spotify connect](#spotify-connect) device list.

#### Audio backend

`spotify_player` uses [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio) as the default [audio backend](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Audio-Backends). List of available audio backends:

- `alsa-backend`
- `pulseaudio-backend`
- `rodio-backend`
- `portaudio-backend`
- `jackaudio-backend`
- `rodiojack-backend`
- `sdl-backend`
- `gstreamer-backend`

User can change the audio backend when building/installing the application by specifying the `--features` option. For example, to install `spotify_player` with `pulseaudio-backend`, run

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features pulseaudio-backend
```

**Note**:

- needs to specify `--no-default-features` here because `rodio-backend` is one of the default features.
- user will need to install additional dependencies depending on the selected audio backend. More details can be found in the [Librespot documentation](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Compiling#general-dependencies).

The `streaming` feature can be also disabled upon installing by running

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features
```

### Lyric

To enable lyric support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `lyric-finder` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `lyric-finder` feature included run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features lyric-finder
```

User can view lyric of the currently playing track by calling the `LyricPage` command to go the lyric page. To do this, `spotify_player` needs to be built with a `lyric-finder` feature.

Under the hood, `spotify_player` retrieves the song's lyric using [Genius.com](https://genius.com).

### Media Control

To enable media control support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `media-control` feature (**enabled** by default) and set the `enable_media_control` config option to `true` in the [general configuration file](docs/config.md#media-control).

Media control support is implemented using [MPRIS DBus](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/MPRIS) on Linux and OS window event listener on Windows and MacOS.

### Image

To enable image rendering support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `image` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `image` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features image
```

`spotify_player` supports rendering image in a full resolution if the application is run on either [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/) or [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). Otherwise, the image will be displayed as [block characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements).

`spotify_player` also supports rendering images with `sixel` behind `sixel` feature flag, which also enables `image` feature:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features sixel
```

**Notes**:

- Not all terminals supported by [libsixel](https://github.com/saitoha/libsixel) are supported by `spotify_player` as it relies on a [third-party library](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer) for image rendering. A possible list of supported terminals can be found in [here](https://github.com/atanunq/viuer/blob/dc81f44a97727e04be0b000712e9233c92116ff8/src/printer/sixel.rs#L83-L95).
- Images rendered by `sixel` can have a _weird_ scale. It's recommended to tweak the `cover_img_scale` config option to get the best result as the scaling works differently with different terminals and fonts.

Examples of image rendering:

- iTerm2:

![iTerm2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40011582/172966798-0aadc431-b0c3-4433-adf3-7526684fc2a0.png)

- Kitty:

- Sixel (`foot` terminal, `cover_img_scale=1.8`):

### Notify

To enable desktop notification support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `notify` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `notify` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features notify
```

**Note**: the notification support in `MacOS` and `Windows` are quite restricted compared to `Linux`.

### Mouse support

Currently, the only supported use case for mouse is to seek to a position of the current playback by left-clicking to such position in the playback's progress bar.

### Daemon

To enable a [daemon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)>) support, `spotify_player` needs to be built/installed with `daemon` feature (**disabled** by default). To install the application with `daemon` feature included, run:

```shell
cargo install spotify_player --features daemon
```

You can run the application as a daemon by specifying the `-d` or `--daemon` option: `spotify_player -d`.

**Notes**:

- `daemon` feature requires the `streaming` feature to be enabled and the application to be built with [an audio backend](#audio-backend)
- because of the OS's restrictions, `daemon` feature doesn't work with the `media-control` feature on Windows and MacOS, which is **enabled by default**. In other words, if you want to use the `daemon` feature on Windows or MacOS, you must install the application with `media-control` feature **disabled**:

  ```shell
  cargo install spotify_player --no-default-features --features daemon,rodio-backend
  ```

### CLI Commands

`spotify_player` offers several CLI commands to interact with **a running `spotify_player` instance**.

Under the hood, the application handles a CLI command by sending requests to a `spotify_player` instance's client socket running on the `client_port` port, a general application configuration with a default value `8080`.

For more details, run `spotify_player -h` or `spotify_player {command} -h`, in which `{command}` is a CLI command.

## Commands

To add new shortcuts or modify the default shortcuts, please refer to the [keymaps section](docs/config.md#keymaps) in the configuration documentation.

**Tips**:

- `RefreshPlayback` can be used to manually update the playback status.
- `RestartIntegratedClient` is useful when user wants to switch to another audio device (headphone, earphone, etc) without restarting the application, as the integrated client will be re-initialized with the new device.

A list of actions is available for each type of Spotify item (track, album, artist, or playlist).
For example, the list of available actions on a track is `[GoToAlbum, GoToArtist, GoToTrackRadio, GoToArtistRadio, GoToAlbumRadio, AddToPlaylist, DeleteFromCurrentPlaylist, AddToLikedTracks, DeleteFromLikedTracks]`.

To get the list of actions on an item, call the `ShowActionsOnCurrentTrack` command or `ShowActionsOnSelectedItem` command, then press enter (default binding for `ChooseSelected` command) to initiate the selected action.

### Search Page

When first entering the search page, the application focuses on the search input. User can then input text, delete one character backward using `backspace`, or search the text using `enter`.

To move the focus from the search input to the other windows such as track results, album results, etc, use `FocusNextWindow` or `FocusPreviousWindow`.

## Configurations

By default, `spotify_player` will look into `$HOME/.config/spotify-player` for application's configuration files. This can be changed by either specifying `-c <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--config-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.

If an application configuration file is not found, one will be created with default values.

Please refer to [the configuration documentation](docs/config.md) for more details on the configuration options.

## Caches

By default, `spotify_player` will look into `$HOME/.cache/spotify-player` for application's cache files, which include log files, Spotify's authorization credentials, audio cache files, etc. This can be changed by either specifying `-C <FOLDER_PATH>` or `--cache-folder <FOLDER_PATH>` option.

### Logging

The application stores logs inside the `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/spotify-player-*.log` file. For debugging or submitting an issue, user can also refer to the backtrace file in `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/spotify-player-*.backtrace`, which includes the application's backtrace in case of panics/unexpected errors.

`spotify_player` uses `RUST_LOG` environment variable to define the application's [logging level](https://docs.rs/log/0.4.14/log/enum.Level.html). `RUST_LOG` is default to be `spotify_player=INFO`, which only shows the application's logs.

## Acknowledgement

`spotify_player` is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and is built on top of awesome libraries such as [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs), [rspotify](https://github.com/ramsayleung/rspotify), [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot), and [many more](spotify_player/Cargo.toml). It's highly inspired by [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) and [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot).
