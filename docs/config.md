## General

**The default `app.toml` can be found in the example [`app.toml`](../examples/app.toml) file.**

`spotify_player` uses `app.toml` to configure general application configurations:

### Notes

- By default, `spotify_player` uses the official Spotify Web app's client (`client_id = 65b708073fc0480ea92a077233ca87bd`)
- It's recommended to specify [your own Client ID](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps) to avoid possible rate limits and to allow a full [Spotify connect](https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/) support.
- `ap_port` and `proxy` are [Librespot's session configurations](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Behind-web-proxy). By default, `spotify_player` doesn't set those values, which means the Librespot library will fallback to use its default options.
- Positive-value `app_refresh_duration_in_ms` is used to refresh the playback periodically. This can result in hitting a Spotify rate limit if the application is running for a long time.
- To prevent the rate limit, `spotify_player` sets `playback_refresh_duration_in_ms=0` by default and makes additional API calls when there is an event or a command triggering a playback update.
- List of commands that triggers a playback update:

  - `NextTrack`
  - `PreviousTrack`
  - `ResumePause`
  - `PlayRandom`
  - `Repeat`
  - `Shuffle`
  - `SeekTrack` (left-clicking the playback's progress bar)
  - `ChooseSelected` (for a track, a device, etc)

  **Note**: the above list might not be up-to-date.

- An example of event that triggers a playback update is the one happening when the current track ends.
- `enable_streaming` can be either `Always`, `Never` or `DaemonOnly`. For backwards compatibility, `true` and `false` are still accepted as aliases for `Always` and `Never`.
- `playback_window_position` can only be either `Top` or `Bottom`.
- `border_type` can be either `Hidden`, `Plain`, `Rounded`, `Double` or `Thick`.
- `progress_bar_type` can be either `Rectangle` or `Line`.
- `notify_streaming_only=true` and `enable_streaming=DaemonOnly` can be set to avoid sending multiple notifications when both daemon and UI are running.

#### Media control

Media control support (`enable_media_control` option) is enabled by default on Linux but disabled by default on MacOS and Windows.

MacOS and Windows require **an open window** to listen to OS media event. As a result, `spotify_player` needs to spawn an invisible window on startup, which may steal focus from the running terminal. To interact with `spotify_player`, which is run on the terminal, user will need to re-focus the terminal. Because of this extra re-focus step, the media control support is disabled by default on MacOS and Windows to avoid possible confusion for first-time users.

### Player event hook command

If specified, `player_event_hook_command` should be an object with two fields `command` and `args`. Each time `spotify_player` receives a new player event, `player_event_hook_command` is executed with the event's data as the script's arguments.

A player event is represented as a list of arguments with either of the following values:

- `"Changed" OLD_TRACK_ID NEW_TRACK_ID`
- `"Playing" TRACK_ID POSITION_MS DURATION_MS`
- `"Paused" TRACK_ID POSITION_MS DURATION_MS`
- `"EndOfTrack" TRACK_ID`

**Note**: if `args` is specified, such arguments will be called before the event's arguments.

For example, if `player_event_hook_command = { command = "a.sh", args = ["-b", "c", "-d"] }`, upon receiving a `Changed` event with `OLD_TRACK_ID=x`, `NEW_TRACK_ID=y`, the following command will be run

```shell
a.sh -b c -d Changed x y
```

Example script that reads event's data from arguments and prints them to a file:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

set -euo pipefail

case "$1" in
    "Changed") echo "command: $1, old_track_id: $2, new_track_id: $3" >> /tmp/log.txt ;;
    "Playing") echo "command: $1, track_id: $2, position_ms: $3, duration_ms: $4" >> /tmp/log.txt ;;
    "Paused") echo "command: $1, track_id: $2, position_ms: $3, duration_ms: $4" >> /tmp/log.txt ;;
    "EndOfTrack") echo "command: $1, track_id: $2" >> /tmp/log.txt ;;
esac
```

### Device configurations

The configuration options for the [Librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) integrated device are specified under the `[device]` section in the `app.toml` file:

| Option          | Description                                                             | Default          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `name`          | The librespot device's name                                             | `spotify-player` |
| `device_type`   | The librespot device's type                                             | `speaker`        |
| `volume`        | Initial volume (in percentage) of the device                            | `70`             |
| `bitrate`       | Bitrate in kbps (`96`, `160`, or `320`)                                 | `320`            |
| `audio_cache`   | Enable caching audio files (store in `$APP_CACHE_FOLDER/audio/` folder) | `false`          |
| `normalization` | Enable audio normalization                                              | `false`          |
| `autoplay`      | Enable autoplay similar songs                                           | `false`          |

More details on the above configuration options can be found under the [Librespot wiki page](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options).

## Themes

`spotify_player` uses the `theme.toml` config file to look for user-defined themes.

**An example of user-defined themes can be found in the example [`theme.toml`](../examples/theme.toml) file.**

The application's theme can be modified by setting the `theme` config option in `app.toml` or by specifying the `-t <THEME>` (`--theme <THEME>`) CLI option when running the player.

A theme has three main components: `name` (the theme's name), `palette` (the theme's color palette), `component_style` (styles for specific application's components).

`name` is required when defining a new theme. If `palette` is not set, a palette based on the terminal's colors will be used. If `component_style` is not set, a set of predefined component styles will be used.

### Use script to add theme

[a `theme_parse` python script](../scripts/theme_parse) (require `pyaml` and `requests` libraries) can be used to parse [Iterm2 alacritty's color schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/alacritty) into a `spotify_player` compatible theme format.

For example, you can run

```
./theme_parse "Builtin Solarized Dark" "solarized_dark"  >> ~/.config/spotify-player/theme.toml
```

to parse [Builtin Solarized Dark](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/alacritty/Builtin%20Solarized%20Dark.yml) color scheme into a new theme with `name = "solarized_dark"`.

### Palette

A theme's palette consists of the following fields:

- `background`
- `foreground`
- `black`
- `blue`
- `cyan`
- `green`
- `magenta`
- `red`
- `white`
- `yellow`
- `bright_black`
- `bright_blue`
- `bright_cyan`
- `bright_green`
- `bright_magenta`
- `bright_red`
- `bright_white`
- `bright_yellow`

If a field is not specified, a default value based on the terminal's corresponding color will be used.

A field's value can be set to be either a hex representation of a RGB color (e.g, `background = "#1e1f29"`) or a string representation of the color (e.g `red`, `bright_blue`, etc).

More details about the palette's field naming can be found in the table in the [3-bit and 4-bit section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit).

### Component Styles

To define application's component styles, the user can specify any of the below fields:

- `block_title`
- `border`
- `playback_status`
- `playback_track`
- `playback_artists`
- `playback_album`
- `playback_metadata`
- `playback_progress_bar`
- `current_playing`
- `page_desc`
- `table_header`
- `selection`
- `secondary_row`

A field in `component_style` is a struct with three **optional** fields: `fg` (foreground), `bg` (background) and `modifiers` (terminal effects):

- `fg` and `bg` can be either a palette's color in a pascal case (e.g, `BrightBlack`, `Blue`, etc) or a hex representation of a RGB color (e.g, `"#1e1f29"`). The default values for `fg` and `bg` are the `palette`'s `foreground` and `background`.
- The default value for `modifiers` is `[]`. `modifiers` can consist of
  - `Bold`
  - `Dim`
  - `Italic`
  - `Underlined`
  - `SlowBlink`
  - `Reversed`
  - `RapidBlink`
  - `Hidden`
  - `CrossedOut`

Default value for application's component styles:

```toml
block_title = { fg = "Magenta"  }
border = {}
playback_status = { fg = "Cyan", modifiers = ["Bold"] }
playback_track = { fg = "Cyan", modifiers = ["Bold"] }
playback_artists = { fg = "Cyan", modifiers = ["Bold"] }
playback_album = { fg = "Yellow" }
playback_metadata = { fg = "BrightBlack" }
playback_progress_bar = { bg = "BrightBlack", fg = "Green" }
current_playing = { fg = "Green", modifiers = ["Bold"] }
page_desc = { fg = "Cyan", modifiers = ["Bold"] }
playlist_desc = { fg = "BrightBlack", modifiers = ["Dim"] }
table_header = { fg = "Blue" }
selection = { modifiers = ["Bold", "Reversed"] }
```

## Keymaps

`spotify_player` uses `keymap.toml` to add or override new key mappings in additional to [the default key mappings](../README.md#commands). To define a new key mapping, simply add a `keymaps` entry. To remove a key mapping, set its command to `None`. For example,

```toml
[[keymaps]]
command = "NextTrack"
key_sequence = "g n"
[[keymaps]]
command = "PreviousTrack"
key_sequence = "g p"
[[keymaps]]
command = "Search"
key_sequence = "C-c C-x /"
[[keymaps]]
command = "ResumePause"
key_sequence = "M-enter"
[[keymaps]]
command = "None"
key_sequence = "q"
```

## Actions

Actions are located in the same `keymap.toml` file as keymaps. An action can be triggered by a key sequence that is not bound to any command. Once the mapped key sequence is pressed, the corresponding action will be triggered **on the currently selected item**. For example,
a list of actions can be found [here](../README.md#actions).

```toml
[[actions]]
action = "GoToArtist"
key_sequence = "g A"
[[actions]]
action = "GoToAlbum"
key_sequence = "g B"
[[actions]]
action="ToggleLiked"
key_sequence="C-l"
```
